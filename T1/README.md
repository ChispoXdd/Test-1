***Description***

I am a boy from Granada who is studying 1st year of daw, in bilingual. Previously, apart from studying ESO, I studied a middle degree in Microcomputer Systems and Networks. I like computers and video games. I consider myself a happy and hard-working person. Little more.

***Development Environments***

A brief description of development environments: A development environment, also known as an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), is software that provides integrated tools and features to facilitate software development. This environment offers programmers a set of tools, including a code editor, a compiler/interpreter, debugging tools, and other utilities to aid in the process of creating and maintaining software.
I am liking this subject, it is a subject from what I see focused on development software, and for now I am liking both the activities and the subject itself.
